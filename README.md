# darkanakin41/sql-helper

A simple php librarie to grant functionnalities for SQL Generation.

It is for most part based on [doctrine/orm](https://github.com/doctrine/orm) because I love working with Doctrine and it will be easier to move to it in case of a project migration.

Currently, it works with [ADODB4](https://github.com/ADOdb/ADOdb/tree/adodb4) for the need of one of my project but it might be upgraded in a near future to handle more tools

Feel free to fork it and adapt it to your need of raw sql generation
